**Ninja vs EVILCORP** is a platformer inspired by Super Meat Boy, Stealth Bastard Deluxe, and other great similar games.
The goal is to scale a tower to find the evil plans without getting spotted.

Levels were designed to offer obvious routes, as well as more difficult alternate routes, and a timer to allow speed running.
